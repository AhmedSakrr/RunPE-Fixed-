# RunPE ( Fixed , Improved Version )
This library helps you to execute a PE32 process in the same address space as the host process from memory by bytes arrays.

# Origins
This guy (Zer0Mem0ry) developed the main code and left the project alone with a general error from uninitialized pointers!
https://github.com/Zer0Mem0ry/RunPE

I fixed it , feel free to use it :)

# Fixes :
- Useless values removed.
- Randomly Crashes On >> (The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). click OK to close the application.) Fixed.


# Using :
- RunPE32_From_Memory.cpp /// fixed version
- RunPE32_From_Memory.rar /// Visual Studio 2012 Project

Cheers,
